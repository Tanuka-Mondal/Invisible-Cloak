# Invisible-Cloak
This is a real time invisible cloak using opencv in python. At first the camera will store the picture of the backgroud, then when someone come infront of the camera and cover themselve with a red cloth, the foreground of the red potion will be replaced by the backgroud picture. So basically the red cloth will look like an invisible cloak.
